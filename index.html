High-energy covalent bonds exist between α and β, and between β and γ.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The phosphate bonds between Phosphate groups are the high-energy sites of ATP. When a bond breaks, a phosphate group (often the γ-phosphate) is released along with energy, converting ATP into ADP (Adenosine diphosphate). Further bond breakage releases another phosphate group (β-phosphate), resulting in AMP (Adenosine monophosphate) with only one phosphate group remaining.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>High-Energy Phosphates Play a Central Role in Energy Capture and Transfer</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>In biochemical reactions, the energy contained in phosphate bonds varies depending on the substance. Therefore, the transfer of phosphate groups also represents energy transfer, enabling biochemical reactions to be driven. Based on their energy level compared to ATP, they are classified as High-energy Phosphates and Low-energy Phosphates.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>High-Energy Phosphates (or Phosphagens)</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>During metabolism, the free energy released upon hydrolysis of High-energy Phosphates is greater than that released by ATP hydrolysis to ADP. Therefore, the hydrolysis of High-energy Phosphates can transfer Pi to ADP, generating ATP.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Examples of High-energy Phosphate compounds:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Phosphoenolpyruvate</span></p></li><li><p><span>Carbamoyl phosphate: Found in nucleotide metabolism, its energy level difference is also higher than that of ATP conversion to ADP.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Creatine phosphate: Its energy level is higher than that of ATP hydrolysis to ADP. In higher vertebrates, when ATP concentration is high, Creatine phosphate is formed by attaching Phosphate to Creatine, storing excess energy. When ATP is insufficient, the higher energy of Creatine phosphate hydrolysis allows the transfer of the phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>(112 Supplement)</span></strong><span> Creatine acts like a battery within cells, regulating the balance of ATP and ADP concentrations.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>ATP → AMP + PPi:</span></strong><span> ATP loses 2 phosphate groups, and the energy level of the phosphate bond between α and β is higher than that released between β and γ. The released energy can convert ADP into ATP (although this usage is less efficient). Therefore, it is classified as a High-energy phosphate. This reaction is involved in fat metabolism.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>(98 Supplement)</span></strong><span> 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate: When 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate converts to 3-Phosphoglycerate, the high-energy phosphate bond at C-1 allows ADP to become ATP.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Low-Energy Phosphates</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>The energy released from bond breakage in Low-energy Phosphate compounds is smaller, insufficient to add the resulting Pi to ADP and generate ATP. Therefore, Pi is released freely; during reactions, it needs to combine with a phosphate group from ATP hydrolysis (increasing the energy level).</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>Examples of Low-energy Phosphate compounds:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Glucose 1-phosphate: Hydrolysis of the phosphate group at C-1 cannot drive ADP conversion to ATP, hence its classification as a Low-energy phosphate.</span></p></li><li><p><span>PPi</span></p></li><li><p><span>Fructose 6-phosphate</span></p></li><li><p><span>Glucose 6-phosphate: Reactant in step 2 of glycolysis.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Glycerol 3-phosphate: Involved in fat metabolism.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><h3 id='v-high-energy-phosphates-act-as-the-energy-currency-of-the-cell'><span>V.

When energy is abundant and the ATP/ADP ratio is high, the concentration of Creatine phosphate increases to store High-energy phosphate. When the ATP/ADP ratio is low, High-energy phosphate is transferred to ADP through the action of Creatine kinase, generating ATP.</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>(104 Supplement)</span></strong><span> High-energy phosphates have two meanings: They can refer to high-energy phosphate bonds or compounds carrying these bonds.

Thermodynamic Significance of ATP</span></h3><ol start='' ><li><p><strong><span>Importance of ATP:</span></strong><span> Enabling thermodynamically unfavorable biochemical reactions to proceed.</span></p><ul><li><p><span>In certain biochemical reactions, ATP first phosphorylates reactants, transferring the energy from phosphate bond to low-energy reactants. This elevates the energy level of the reactants, facilitating their progression from a high energy state to a lower energy state, tending towards maximum entropy (Second Law of Thermodynamics), allowing downstream reactions to proceed smoothly.</span></p></li><li><p><span>These reactions can be either endergonic or exergonic.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Examples of Reactions Involving ATP:</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Steps 1 and 3 of Glycolysis utilize ATP to increase energy levels, aiding in the progression of Glycolysis (e.g., Step 1: ATP + Glucose → ADP + Glucose-6-Phosphate).</span></p></li><li><p><span>Glucose metabolism only requires the energy from the phosphate bond between β and γ. However, the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids requires the energy from the phosphate bond between α and β: Attaching the Fatty acid to Acetyl-CoA to form R-CO-SCoA is necessary for entry into the TCA cycle for metabolism.</span></p></li><li><p><span>ATP + CoA-SH + R-COOH → AMP + PPi + R-CO-ScoA</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>Conversion between ATP/ADP/AMP (regulated by enzymes):</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Taking the AMP produced in the aforementioned &quot;long-chain fatty acid metabolism&quot; reaction as an example, one AMP is converted into ATP by two ATP molecules under the action of Adenylyl kinase, generating two ADP molecules (see point 2 below). Meanwhile, PPi is converted into two Pi molecules by Inorganic pyrophosphatase.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The conversion of 1 AMP to ADP (enzyme: Adenylyl Kinase) consumes one ATP. The subsequent conversion of ADP to ATP consumes another ATP, resulting in a total consumption of 2 ATP and the generation of one ATP (from AMP conversion) and two ADP (from two ATP conversions).</span></p></li><li><p><strong><span>(113 Supplement)</span></strong><span> In addition to the energy sources mentioned above, another potential energy source is from the citric acid cycle and other metabolic pathways.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Why doesn&#39;t it consume only one ATP and generate two ADP (one from ATP and one from AMP conversion)? This is due to enzyme specificity. (Simply put, under the action of this enzyme, AMP phosphorylation must proceed all the way to ATP).</span></p></li><li><p><span>The reaction AMP + PPi → ATP does not occur directly because PPi is immediately hydrolyzed into two Pi by Inorganic pyrophosphatase, ensuring the reaction proceeds unidirectionally.</span></p></li><li><p><span>AMP acts as a metabolic signal. High AMP concentration indicates energy deficiency in tissues. In this situation, there is insufficient ADP to generate ATP (Catabolic reaction) because most phosphorylation reactions (such as Glycolysis) require ADP as a reactant, not AMP. Therefore, excess AMP triggers Adenylyl kinase activation to facilitate ADP regeneration, further synthesizing ATP.</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong><span>(105 Supplement) Formation of Nucleoside Triphosphates</span></strong></p><ul><li><p><span>Apart from the aforementioned pathways, Nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase can convert UDP, GDP, and CDP into high-energy Nucleoside triphosphates (NTP): UTP, GTP, and CTP.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The conversion of Nucleoside monophosphates (NMP) to NDPs is catalyzed by NMP kinase.
